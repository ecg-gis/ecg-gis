			<p>Our research spans a few domains in Evolutionary and Cancer Genomics.</p>
	
			<h2>Cancer Genomics</h2>
			<p>In cancer genomics, we are interested in the origin and evolution of intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH). Focusing on lung and liver cancers, we are conducting multi-sectoring sequencing of multiple tumors, understanding the amount and origin of ITH. In lung cancer, we joined the flagship program (Translational and Clinical Research, TCR) together with my colleagues (Axel, Bing, Wai Leong and Daniel) trying to understand the ITH in lung adenocarcinoma in East Asian patients. In Liver cancer, we are collaborating with Pierce Chow and many other colleagues trying to understand the natural history of liver cancers (We were awarded a TCR program in April 2016). </p>
			<p>In the long run, we are interested in connecting the profile of ITH to macro-phenotypes (e.g. patient survival or clinical trajectories, patient image data etc) and with micro-phenotypes (cancer microenvironment and immune-profiling, cancer metabolism etc). Understanding the clonal architecture during disease progression and targeting residual disease is a key direction we would like to head to.</p>

			<h2>Evolutionary Genetics</h2>
			<h3>1) The evolution of influenza virus</h3>

			<p>How flu virus adapts to the human environment is an interesting question for us. In particular, we are keen on understanding the long term trajectories of influenza adaptation and what are the evolutionary driving forces promoting flu adaptation. We are employing a sampling strategy called mutational mapping to study flu adaptation across space and time. In the past few years, we have been interested in understanding passage adaptation (when clinical strains were propagated in the culturing medium, the viral population adapts to the environment. This process is called passage adaptation). Passage adaptation can cause serious issues to vaccine production/efficacy and public health management. </p>

			<h3>2) The evolution of domestic dogs</h3>

			</center>
			<br>
			<p>Domesticated animals and plants are the basis of modern civilization.  How these species adapt to the societal need is an interesting evolutionary question.  Understanding the genetic basis of these large morphological and physiological changes is an important first step for breed improvement.  We have been employing the state of the art genomic and population genetic approach in understanding dog evolution.  Collaborating with colleagues from Kunming Institute of Zoology (Yaping Zhang and Guodong Wang), we have made a series of discoveries in dog evolution and global migration. </p>

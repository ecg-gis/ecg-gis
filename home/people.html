					<p style="margin-bottom: 30px;"><b>ZHAI Weiwei</b>, I am an evolutionary geneticist focusing on using statistical and computational approaches in addressing questions in Population Genetics and Molecular Evolution. With recent experiences in genomics, my research interests include these directions:1) Cancer genomics, especially the origin and distribution of intra-tumor heterogeneity in lung and liver cancers. I am interested in bringing population genetics, single cell genomics and stem biology to the study of cancer evolution. 2) In the natural world, I am interested in the evolution of dogs and influenza. The major interest for us is understanding how species adapt to the environment.</p>

					<p style="margin-bottom: 30px;"><b>CHEN Hui</b>, I got my undergraduate training in Bioinformatics from Soochow University, P.R.C. After that, I pursued my PhD (2009 - 2013) at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. During my PhD, I mainly focused on studying the host cell transcriptomic changes in different cell lines infected with different influenza viruses. In parallel, I also helped establishing a pathogen-diagnostic system collaborating with Singapore national lab. After joining Dr. Zhai Weiwei's lab in 2013,the major scientific question we want to address in the past two years is how influenza virus adapts to human hosts. We applied a likelihood-based method for mapping mutations on phylogeny. Recently, I start to pick up sequence analysis of next generation sequence data and I am hoping to expose myself more to population genetic theories in the near future.</p>

Tong received his Ph.D. in Structural Biology from School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University (2015), where he focused on understanding the mechanism of inhibitors against Alzheimer's Disease using computer simulations. Prior to his Ph.D., he received his B.S. in Biology from School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University (2010). Tong joined our lab on Nov, 2014. Since then, Tong was studying the intra-tumour heterogeneity in Asian Lung and Liver Cancers.</p>

					<p style="margin-bottom: 30px;"><b>YANG Hechuan</b>, I got my bachelor degree in Biotechnology from Jilin University in 2008. I then began to pursue Ph.D in Genetics at the University of Science and Technology of China. During my research expedition, I spent 4 years (2009.9 to 2013.8) at Beijing Institute of Genomics (CAS) as a visiting student. I then spent one year, from 2014.11 at Genome Institute of Singapore as a visiting student. After returning to China, I continued my studies at Kunming Institute of Zoology (CAS). The focus of my research over all these years has been on resolving the mysteries on dog domestication using genomic approaches.In GIS, I am taking population genetic approaches trying to understand tumor evolution.</p>

					<p style="margin-bottom: 30px;"><b>Jia Qi LIM</b>, I am a research officer in the group. Previously, I did my attachment with this team as well. I spent half of time playing with genome technologies in the wet lab. The other half my time, I learn how to employ the computational tools addressing questions surrounding caner genomics. I have explored on: theidentification and validation of fusion gene in lung and liver cancer, single cell genomics on Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs). My aim is to contribute to better Liver cancer treatment and clinical outcome through the discovery of the research projects.</p>

During college, I worked on comparative protein dynamics analyses in extremophile organisms. After college, I applied for SINGA program and came to Singapore for my PhD. Now, I am a PhD student at the Genome Institute of Singapore and School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University. My main research focuses are cancer genomics and intra-tumor heterogeneity in liver cancer. </p>

					<p style="margin-bottom: 70px;"><b>Chen Jian Bin</b>, I gained my B.Sc degree from Sun Yat-sen University major in Biotechnology in 2011. I pursued my Ph.D. degree in National University of Singapore, focusing on the early development of medaka fish. Collaborating with my colleagues, I developed a robust and efficient method for detecting gene editing products from TALEN and CRISPR-Cas, and put forth a method for potential real-time visualisation of specific RNA molecules. Meanwhile, I participated in transcriptome analysis of medaka fish, which triggered my interest in genomics. I join Weiwei's group in Mar. 2017. I am currently interested in cancer genomics, especially in cancer heterogeneity. </p>

					<p style="margin-bottom: 70px;"><b>Jacob ALVAREZ</b>, I am an attachment student reading a bachelor's degree in Life Sciences from NUS, specialising in biomedical sciences. During a research internship in Temasek Life Sciences , I worked on genetic engineering and protein synthesis of terpene synthases from mint and basil. I also took up a computational research project on microRNAs in NUS, involving the prediction and characterization of miRNAs in the Tobacco plant. This kickstarted my interest in bioinformatics and led me to joining Weiwei's lab group for my Final Year Project in 2016, where I explored passage adaptations occurring in pandemic H1N1 Influenza. I hope to further continue my training in Weiwei's lab for the rest of my attachment period, particularly in cancer genomics.
